### Modifications

This project is based on a template originally created for a responsive portfolio. I have made several modifications and enhancements to the template, including the addition of several components taken from the [Agency Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme), which provides a more modern and dynamic layout for showcasing experiences and portfolio.

### Features:
- Added new sections and updated the layout to enhance user experience.
- Improved visual elements, making the website cleaner and more interactive.
- Integrated components from the Agency Jekyll Theme, such as the experience section and portfolio display.
